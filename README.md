The only file you will need to copy the data is the update_json.py one.

usage:

`$ python update_json.py [glueboss-data.csv] [glueboss-data.json]`

Just make sure you reference the glueboss-data.csv and glueboss-data.json files locations or that they are in the same folder as the update_json.py file when you run the program.

Python should be set up so you just need to open up your teminal and get to this project folder.



# Get started

1. Just copy this repo to your local machine. You can download as a zip or use the git command line tool
2. Open up terminal and `cd` into the project folder `$ cd path/to/project/folder/`
3. Run the program: `$ python update_json.py`

# updating data

Just do the "get started" steps but download the glueboss-data.csv into the project folder before hand. You will want to override the existing glueboss-data.csv
